AndroidJS
===
Author native and hybrid applications for the Android operating system with pure JavaScript. AndroidJS a web tech abstraction orgy on top of Android enabled by the crazy awesome DroidScript project by Mikael Kindborg. 
Migrate project to Android Studio

Rhino Features
---
- CommonJS Modules 1.1 implementation. 
- ES5 compliant JavaScript interpreter.

DroidScript Features
---
- Near complete access to the entire Android SDK and then entire underlying Java stack _from JavaScript_.
- Clean binding of Rhino to the Android lifecycle.
- Helpers for evaluating JavaScript from various sources.

AndroidJS Features
---
- Native Android API wrappers to make things more natural to JavaScript. (And less Java!)
- Awesome examples for creating native controls, capturing touch input, creating web servers and webviews.
- 

Examples in `./src/assets/examples`. Check out the API docs in `./doc`. 

Current Work / Ideas
---
- notifications
- create either activitiy or service style projects
- intents
- more gui wrappers
- canvas api on top of android.graphics
- opengl webgl api binding
- PhoneGap enabled WebView
- Build scripts
- CoffeeScript support by way of http://github.com/yeungda/jcoffeescript
